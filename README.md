# Atreyu keyboard

Making a Lily58fied version of the Atreis keyboard.

Based on [Dekonnection's Atreis keyboard design files](https://github.com/dekonnection/atreis),
modified to achieve the same layout in a single-piece form-factor.

## What's new?

Rev2 of the keyboard comes with new features:

* New options for MCUs:
  * Pro Micro: with this MCU the functionality of the keyboard is only reduced by not being able to use encoders.
  * Elite-C, Elite-Pi, Puchi, Frood: all the functioinality, i.e., OLED, encoders, all keys.
  * Nice!Nano v2: all functionality plus wireless!
* OLED pins
* Space for a battery, with power kill switch and pins for soldering the battery to the PCB, currently for a 500mAh 
  * Different versions of the PCB will be released for different battery sizes.
* 5 underglow LED (SK6812Mini-E slots) as status indicators.

The new Rev2 revision is not pin-compatible with Rev1.

| MCU     | OLED |Encoders | Bluetooth (ZMK) | LEDs |
|---------|------|---------|-----------------|------|
|ProMicro | âœ…   | ðŸš§      |                 | âœ…   |
|Elite-C  | âœ…   | âœ…      |                 | âœ…   |
|nice!nano| ðŸš§   | âœ…      | âœ…              | âœ…   |

Some pins are shared across the OLED, the encoders and the LEDs, so they require sacrificing one in favour of the other. E.g., in a board with OLED and LEDs, one can only have one encoder.

NOTE: Elite-pi, Frood, and similar rp2040-based boards work the same way as the Elite-C board, as they have the same number of pins available.

### Rev1

The original Rev1 is available, but does not include OLED, LEDs or nice!nano (BT) support.

## Why ?

Because the Atreis is the most convenient keyboard to take when on the go, but I need a couple of extra keys, like the Lily58.

And because we can.

## Why this name ?

It looks a lot like the Atreis keyboard, and borrows some of the features of the Lily58 layout. I kind of combined them and there was something that reminded me to the hero in the "The Neverending Story" book.

## How do I build one ?

You can find a [PCB](http://github.com/climent/atreyu/tree/main/pcb) for it, but it is still untested, so for now you can download the SVG and get it cut from Ponoko.com or a similar place. The wiring is quite straightforward: all rows are independent, and columns are combined together across both sides (columns are connected from outside to inside). You can [check this picture](pictures/atreyu-wired.jpg?raw=true "The wires").

# Firmware

You can find my copy of the keyboard mapping [here.](http://github.com/climent/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/atreyu/)

I will eventually do a merge request in upstream QMK.
