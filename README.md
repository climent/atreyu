# Atreyu keyboard

Making a better version of the Atreis keyboard.

Based on [Dekonnection's Atreis keyboard design files](https://github.com/dekonnection/atreis),
modified to achieve the same layout in a single-piece form-factor.

## Why ?

Because the Atreis is the most convenient keyboard to take when on the go, but I need an extra key, like the Lily58.

And because we can.

## Why this name ?

Because it looks a lot like the Atreis keyboard, but with the Lily58 layout.

## How do I build one ?

Unfortunately, I'm not planning on designing a PCB for it, so you're on your own to laser-cut the plates and hand-wire it.

# Firmware

WIP

I will eventually do a merge request in upstream QMK.
